% Note to Grader: Please ensure that all of the supplied images are in the same directory as the scripts
% my file filter function will only work if the file is in the exact same directory as the matlab scripts
% do not try to put the images in another directory and simply add to path.  I tried to mimic this structure
% by including the images with my matlab scripts in my submission.  I automated the filter pattern search in the
% current script directory to make it easier to type in the filenames

% you can alternatively pass the filename to the function arguements for each problem, if you want to place the image
% in another location.  See the commented versions of the function calls below

%close any pre-opened figures
close all 

%run all of the subproblems of the assignment, where each subproblem is its own function

% uncomment the secondary statements if the image files are not in the same exact directories as the script files
% and then comment out the first statements.  Otherwise, leave as is
